# Sparkle
Sparkle is an integrated development environment for GemStone Smalltalk, with the GUI running in Pharo Smalltalk remotely from the GemStone server.

## Name(s)
The official name is **Pharo IDE for GemStone**. 
Pharo's symbol is the lighthouse. Considerations of what might result from interaction between a lighthouse and a gemstone led to the codename **Sparkle**.

## Status
Sparkle is at present very much a work in progress, and is undergoing quite active development.

## Installation
There are installation instructions in the Documentation directory of the repository: [SparkleInstallGuide-1.0a1-v2.pdf](https://github.com/GemTalk/Sparkle/blob/development/Documentation/SparkleInstallGuide-1.0a1-v2.pdf)

## Use
A short video demonstrating a _very_ early version of Sparkle can be seen [here](https://vimeo.com/495380967). Since improvements to Sparkle are ongoing, this video is quite out of date.
