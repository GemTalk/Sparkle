A taskspace consists of some number of explorer windows containing some number of panes.

The TaskspaceTool's responsibility is keeping track of what explorers there are.

Its undo and redo operations have to do with the addition and removal of explorer tools.

A TaskspaceTool can be persistent, and can be named. If named, it can be recalled by name upon login.
