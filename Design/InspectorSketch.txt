Sketch of a simple inspector

Object inspection service
  Provides a terse description of a server object (class, oop if it is committed)
  Provides an ordered list of fields, virtual or real
  Provides attributes for each field that can be used by the presenter to indicate how to represent each field (face, color, put it in a different)
  For each field, provides a service
    For virtual fields, this might be just a text service
    For fields that refer to an actual object, this is an Object description service
  Is canonical for the object -- there can be no more than one object inspection service for the same object in a single session

Object Description service
  Provides a text description of an object
  Is canonical for the object -- no matter how many other services want this object described, there will be no more than one description service.
  
Text service
  Provides a string
  Not canonical, pretty stupid. 
  Polymorphic with the object description service for getting its string with getting the description
