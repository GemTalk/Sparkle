# Sparkle
The Sparkle Development Environment is an integrated development environment for GemStone Smalltalk, with the GUI running in Pharo Smalltalk remotely from the GemStone server.

## Name 
Pharo's symbol is the lighthouse. Considerations of what might result from interaction between a lighthouse and a gemstone led to the name **Sparkle**.

## Status
Sparkle is at present very much a work in progress, and is undergoing quite active development.

## Installation
There are installation instructions in the Documentation directory of the repository: [SparkleInstallGuide.md](./Documentation/SparkleInstall.md)

## Use
There are two short videos demonstrating early versions of Sparkle as of April 2021: [Part 1](https://vimeo.com/539470570) and [Part 2](https://vimeo.com/539492134). Since improvements to Sparkle have been ongoing, these videos are rather out of date, but should be useful for new users.

For more recent information, see the [UKSTUG presentation](https://vimeo.com/676889959) and demonstration of Sparkle from January 2022. This gives a more in-depth background on Sparkle and its philosophy, as well as a demonstration.
