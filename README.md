# Sparkle
Sparkle is an integrated development environment for GemStone Smalltalk, with the GUI running in Pharo Smalltalk remotely from the GemStone server.

## Name(s)
The official name is **Pharo IDE for GemStone**. 
Pharo's symbol is the lighthouse. Considerations of what might result from interaction between a lighthouse and a gemstone led to the codename **Sparkle**.

## Status
Sparkle is at present very much a work in progress, and is undergoing quite active development.

## Installation
There are installation instructions in the Documentation directory of the repository: [SparkleInstallGuide.pdf](./Documentation/SparkleInstallGuide-1.0a1-v5.pdf)

## Use
There are two short videos demonstrating Sparkle as of April 2021: [Part 1](https://vimeo.com/539470570) and [Part 2](https://vimeo.com/539492134). Since improvements to Sparkle are ongoing, these videos will be out of date soon.
