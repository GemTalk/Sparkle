The PDF is generated by
1. Using vscodium to render the Markdown to HTML
2. Hand-edit the CSS included in the HTML file
3. View the resulting HTML in Chrome, and print to PDF with background graphics but without headers/footers.
4. Delete the HTML file.

To render to HTML in vscodium
    * Open SparkleInstall.md 
    * Hit F1 key; select "Markdown PDF: Export (html)," part of the Markdown PDF extension.
    
The edits needed to the CSS are:

1. Make the code font bold.
    To the code {} section, add the line
    font-weight: bold;

2. Darken the color of inline code
    In the section :not(pre):not(.hljs) > code {}, change the color from C9AE75 to 602020
